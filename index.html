        <h1 class="container-header">Latest Updates</h1>

        <p class="container-text">
          Yellow has been changed to blue in the new version.
          <u>The new version of QuizMachine is available.</u> See the downloads
          section. Please note that the new USB Interface Boxes must use version
          5 of the program but the new version can be used for older USB
          Interface Boxes. The new program and Interface Boxes will not work
          with Windows XP and Windows 7 (this version may still work but no
          guarantees), as those versions of the Operating System are no longer
          supported. Version 4 will still work and is still available for
          download. <br /><br />
          The equipment on this site is all custom made and can take several
          weeks or more to make depending on the number of open orders. The time
          depends on the number of orders (and availability of parts).
          <br /><br />
          <u>USB Interface Boxes are $135 per box plus shipping costs.</u> The
          new program is backward compatible and must be used with the new
          interface boxes. Thank you for your patience as we have purchased all
          the material and anticipate the program to work soon after testing.

        <p class="container-text">
          We can replace the pad over with new material and sew all 4 sides (no
          glue for longer life). Cost is dependent on what needs to be done. A
          proposal for costs will be sent for approval.

          We can replace the pad over with new material and sew all 4 sides (no

          <u>The cost is $75 per string</u>, shipping now added per string.

          These pads work with QuizMachine and the USB and parallel port
          interface boxes. We CANNOT guarantee the pads to work with any other
          equipment.
